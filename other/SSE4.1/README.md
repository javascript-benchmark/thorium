# Thorium SSE4.1

This directory contains build config files for compiling Thorium/Chromium with [SSE4.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.1).

They can also be edited (and I do exactly this for my occassional Westmere builds) to make [SSE4.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.2) builds.

SSE4.1 is used to target Core 2 Duo systems at a minimum.

I make SSE4.2 builds for 1st Gen core, since I have a laptop with a 1st gen "Westmere" CPU.
